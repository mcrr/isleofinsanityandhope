# Isle of Insanity and Hope

Isle of Insanity & Hope is my personal diary of the second month after
my son's unexpected accidental overdose death by fentanyl and
carfentanil.

It is hoped that reading it may help, in some small way, others who
are living through similar situations either a parent, drug user, or
someone else close to the situation.
