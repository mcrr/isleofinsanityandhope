        <p class="standard">I finished reading the book "The Glass Castle" by Jeannette Walls yesterday. I found that very good reading material at this juncture in my life because it makes my life feel not so horrible. I always appreciate what I have in life because I have been homeless before, not for long but still homeless. And being homeless is one of the things that can make you go insane, kind of like the death of a child. I'm glad that book was able to take me out of my own problems for a little while. I love being a very thankful person and I would never want to become a hard, sad, bitter person for life. I really can't think of anything worse. </p>
